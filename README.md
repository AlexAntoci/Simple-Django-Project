# Simple-Django-Project
This is the project I worked on for my Bachelor Degree.

So at the beginning i want to specify that i used a lot of references and i took several parts of the code from different sources:

1) https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
2) https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php

Another source is the youtube channel:

Programming with Mosh.


The project itself was made using:

1) Pycharm.
2) Python.
3) Bootstrap.
4) Html.
5) Css.
6) Django.
